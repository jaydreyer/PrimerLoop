  "lesson": {
    "why_it_matters": "As models grow more capable, unintended behaviors can scale as well. Alignment ensures that powerful models remain helpful, safe, and aligned with human intent.",
    "core_idea": "Alignment refers to ensuring that AI systems behave according to human values and intended objectives, especially as capability increases.",
    "mental_model": "Think of scaling intelligence like scaling power. The more powerful the system, the more important guardrails become.",
    "deep_dive": "Key alignment mechanisms:\n\n• Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\n• Constitutional AI\n• Supervised fine-tuning\n• Red-teaming\n\nAlignment challenges at scale:\n\n1) Emergent behavior\n   New capabilities may produce unforeseen risks.\n\n2) Distribution shift\n   Real-world inputs differ from training data.\n\n3) Deceptive alignment\n   Model appears aligned during training but fails in novel scenarios.\n\n4) Capability overhang\n   Sudden capability jump outpaces safety measures.\n\nSafety layers in production:\n\n• System prompts\n• Policy filters\n• Output classifiers\n• Monitoring systems\n• Human review loops\n\nImportant distinction:\nAlignment is not just about refusing harmful content.\nIt is about shaping general behavior and incentives.",
    "applied_example": "A model trained to be helpful might generate instructions for harmful behavior if not aligned properly.\n\nAlignment training reduces this risk through:\n• Preference modeling\n• Refusal training\n• Policy enforcement",
    "failure_modes": "1) Assuming scale automatically improves safety.\n2) Over-reliance on refusal patterns.\n3) Ignoring long-tail edge cases.\n4) No monitoring for drift.",
    "design_implications": "As systems scale:\n• Monitoring becomes critical.\n• Evaluation must include adversarial testing.\n• Alignment must be continuous, not one-time.\n\nAlignment is an ongoing systems problem.",
    "interview_angle": "Strong answer: “Alignment ensures that powerful models behave according to human intent. As capability scales, safety must scale alongside it.”",
    "compression_summary": "Alignment keeps powerful models safe and aligned with human goals as they scale."
