  "lesson": {
    "why_it_matters": "Neural networks power most modern AI systems, including large language models. If you understand neural networks at a high level, you understand the foundation of how systems like ChatGPT, image generators, and speech recognition models actually work.",
    "core_idea": "A neural network is a type of machine learning model made of layers of connected units (often called neurons) that transform numbers into other numbers. It learns by adjusting internal weights so that its outputs better match the correct answers during training.",
    "mental_model": "Think of a neural network as a layered calculator. Each layer takes numbers in, multiplies them by weights (importance values), adds them up, and passes them through a function that reshapes them. Layer by layer, the network transforms raw input into a prediction.",
    "deep_dive": "A neural network is composed of layers:\n\n1) Input layer – receives numerical representations of data (for text, images, etc.).\n2) Hidden layers – transform the data through weighted connections and mathematical functions.\n3) Output layer – produces the final prediction.\n\nEach connection has a weight (a number). During training, the model adjusts these weights to reduce error. This adjustment is typically done using gradient descent and backpropagation, which calculate how much each weight contributed to the error.\n\nImportant insight: Neural networks do not store rules. They store learned numerical patterns in the form of weight values.",
    "applied_example": "Example 1 (image recognition): An image is converted into pixel values (numbers). The network processes those numbers through many layers until the final layer outputs probabilities like: Dog 0.92, Cat 0.06, Other 0.02.\n\nExample 2 (language models): Words are converted into numbers (tokens → embeddings). The network processes those numbers through many layers and outputs probabilities for the next token.",
    "failure_modes": "1) Overfitting: The network memorizes training examples.\n2) Vanishing/exploding gradients: Training becomes unstable in deep networks.\n3) Poor generalization: Model performs poorly on unseen data.\n4) Data leakage: Test data accidentally influences training.",
    "design_implications": "Neural networks scale with:\n- More data\n- More parameters (weights)\n- More compute power\n\nLarge neural networks (like LLMs) can have billions of parameters. But bigger models also require more compute, cost more to train, and can be harder to control.\n\nIn production systems, engineers must balance size, cost, and latency.",
    "interview_angle": "Interview-ready framing: “A neural network is a layered function approximator that learns by adjusting weights to minimize prediction error. It transforms input data through multiple nonlinear layers to produce an output.”\n\nIf asked what it ‘stores’: “It stores learned statistical patterns in its weights.”",
    "compression_summary": "A neural network is a layered mathematical system that learns patterns by adjusting numerical weights. It transforms input numbers into output predictions through stacked transformations."
