  "prerequisites": ["neural-networks"],
  "lesson": {
    "why_it_matters": "People often confuse 'AI', 'algorithm', 'architecture', and 'model.' In interviews and system design discussions, being precise matters. A model is the trained artifact — the learned numerical representation that can make predictions.",
    "core_idea": "A model is the trained system that has learned patterns from data. It consists of parameters (weights) that were adjusted during training. When you run inference, you are using a trained model to make predictions.",
    "mental_model": "Think of a model as a frozen brain snapshot. Training shapes it. After training, the learned weights are saved. That saved set of weights — combined with its architecture — is the model.",
    "deep_dive": "Key distinctions:\n\n• Algorithm – The training method (e.g., gradient descent).\n• Architecture – The structure of the network (e.g., transformer, CNN).\n• Model – The trained instance of that architecture with learned weights.\n• Dataset – The data used to train the model.\n• Checkpoint – A saved version of a model’s weights at a point in training.\n\nExample: GPT-4 is not just an architecture. It is a trained transformer model with specific learned weights.\n\nImportant: Two models can share the same architecture but behave differently because they were trained on different data or fine-tuned differently.",
    "applied_example": "Imagine two identical neural network architectures.\n\nModel A trained on medical texts.\nModel B trained on cooking recipes.\n\nSame architecture — different models — different behavior.\n\nThe difference is the learned weights.",
    "failure_modes": "1) Confusing architecture with model.\n2) Assuming models 'contain facts' instead of learned statistical patterns.\n3) Believing models update themselves automatically during use (most do not unless explicitly retrained).",
    "design_implications": "When deploying AI systems, you must track:\n- Model version\n- Training data source\n- Evaluation metrics\n- Checkpoint history\n\nIn production, you rarely modify a model live. You train a new model and deploy a new version.",
    "interview_angle": "Interview-ready framing: “A model is a trained instance of an architecture whose parameters were optimized on data. The learned weights encode statistical patterns that allow the system to generalize to new inputs.”\n\nIf pressed: “Architecture defines structure; training defines behavior.”",
    "compression_summary": "A model is the trained artifact — the architecture plus learned weights that can make predictions. Training shapes it; inference uses it."
